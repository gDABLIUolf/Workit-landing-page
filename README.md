## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project I've decided to practice the CSS grid for the responsiveness, using the mobile-first concept for better performance in small devices.

### Continued development

In the future I will definitively continue using the css grid layout, I realy liked how the page turned out, and of course aways using mobile-first concept.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp) - This helped me understanding the RWD and realy liked the results.
